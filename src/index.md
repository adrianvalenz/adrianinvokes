As a Full Stack Web Developer, with 8+ years of professional experience in the industry, I have designed, developed, and maintained a wide range of applications for
both small businesses and corporations. 

I am a proud member of the Bridgetown core team and I manage a [tech blog](https://mugenruby.com) to show other developers what I have learned.

A few projects I'm really excited about right is a React-based CMS for Bridgetown and a component library for Rails based on GitHub's ViewComponents and TailwindCSS.
