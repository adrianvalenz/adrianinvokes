title: "Hello, my name is Adrian Valenzuela"
---

In my former life I was a barber, but due to a long time intereste in technology, I am now a Full Stack Web Developer. With 8+ years of professional experience in the industry, I have designed, developed, and maintained a wide range of applications for
both small business clients and corporations. 

As a proud member of the Bridgetown core team I have contributed to the project via tutorials and documentation. In my spare time I manage a <span class="text-rose-500 border-b border-rose-500">[tech blog](https://mugenruby.com)</span> to show other developers what I have learned.

I am currently working on a few exciting projects, these include a React-based CMS for Bridgetown and a component library for Rails based on GitHub's ViewComponents and TailwindCSS.

I currently reside on the central coast of California, just five minutes away from the beach with my wife and three beautiful kids. We love watching Disney movies and Harry Potter, all..year..round.
