As a Full Stack Ruby on Rails developer with 7+ years of industry experience, I have designed, developed, and maintained a wide range of applications for both small business clients and corporations.

I am proud to be a member of the Bridgetown Ruby core team and a contributor to Open Source Software.

I am currently developing few OSS gems and building an app to help independent contractors manage taxes...more on that later.

My passion for Ruby includes writing tutorials, mentoring junior developers, and creating innovative projects.
