Before becoming a web developer, I worked as a barber, where I discovered my passion for creating something valuable from scratch. With over 8 years of professional experience, I have designed, developed, and maintained a diverse range of applications for both small businesses and corporations, helping them achieve their goals.

As a proud member of the Bridgetown Core Team, I contribute to the community through tutorials and documentation. In my spare time, I manage a <span class="text-rose-500 border-b border-rose-500">[tech blog](https://mugenruby.com){:target="_blank"}</span> to share insights and knowledge, believing that teaching and learning from one another empowers us to improve our lives.

Currently, I am working on several exciting projects, including a React-based CMS for Bridgetown and a component library for Rails utilizing GitHubâ€™s ViewComponents and TailwindCSS.

I reside on the central coast of California with my wife and three wonderful kids, just five minutes from the beach. We enjoy watching Harry Potter movies, baking pastries, and exploring our favorite hiking trails.
